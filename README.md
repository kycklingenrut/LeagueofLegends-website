# LeagueofLegends-website
My first ever HTML/CSS-project through school. We had to design and populate a website from scratch, in pairs, so i worked with another person on this project.

This was a group project, where we worked with one other person.

The objective was to build a website for a real or fictional customer. We were to make our own project idea and make the idea a reality.
The website had to work well on all widths, spanning 360px, to 980px and higher. A mobile first approach was recommended.
